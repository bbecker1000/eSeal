## note from Sarah 01/04/2019
following sites were growing or changing and weather may effect their growth

Lost Coast (no data yet). Unknown
Point Reyes.              Yes
Farallones storms         limited access
Ano                       NEED INFO FROM SARAH
Gorda Cape San Martin     NEED INFO FROM SARAH
Peidras Blancas           yes
San Miguel                source
Santa Rosa                yes
San Nicolas               source
Santa Barbara             not likely
San Clemente              not likely

## Some ideas
## MARSS
    set sampling error to zero (R.model=matrix(0, nrow = 4, ncol = 4))
    set time period to california site communication
    set covariancve to be negative for nor cal colonies
    develop values for "excess" females each year by site and use those values in MARSS
      compare time series births to next years births @ 95% pupping rate
        Y1: births
        Y3: births should be 0.95*0.95*survivorship
        ANI and mainland: 
          pup survival mainland 91.8(90-93.6), island 71.2(66.3-75.9)
          natality = 97.5(95-99)
          
      assume 50/50 sex ratio (need cite)
      #Point Reyes.             
      #Farallones storms         
      #Ano                       
      #Gorda Cape San Martin    
      
      

Are current PORE expansion rates including immigration? 
    calculate how much growth rate is faster than predicted by pupping
    need 2 year lag for females?

4 site with MEI best model
try adding gorda and possibly all sites and then see what U's are significant with bootstrap.
